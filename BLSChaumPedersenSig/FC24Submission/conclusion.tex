\noindent In this paper we define, instantiate and prove the security properties for an aggregatable BLS signature 
scheme such that when used appropriately, it allows the verifier to essentially store or work only with short public keys 
and signatures because they are in the first target group of the associated BLS pairing. We have implemented
our signature scheme and we have provided concrete benchmarks and an evaluation of its efficiency benefits. We are planning to improve the efficiency of the implementation by applying other 
optimisations related to multi-scalar multiplications.
