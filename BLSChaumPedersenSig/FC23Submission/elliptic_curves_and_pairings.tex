\subsection{Pairings}
\label{sec:pairings}

\noindent Let $E$ be a pairing friendly elliptic curve and let $p$ be the size of its base field and $r$ 
be the size of its scalar field. Let $\eBLS$ be a secure, efficiently computable, 
bilinear, non-degenerate paring defined over $E$ with $\GoneBLS$ and $\GtwoBLS$ as source groups and 
$\GTBLS$ as target group. Let  $\goneBLS$, $\gtwoBLS$, $\gTBLS$ be uniformly random chosen generators 
of these three groups and $\gTBLS = \eBLS(\goneBLS, \gtwoBLS)$. We consider $\GoneBLS$, $\GtwoBLS$ with 
additive notation for their group operation and we consider $\GTBLS$ with multiplicative notation. Moreover, we 
write $[x]_{1} = x \cdot \goneBLS$, $[x]_{2} = x \cdot \gtwoBLS$,  $[x]_{T} = \gTBLS^x$. \\
