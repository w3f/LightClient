\noindent We assume all algorithms receive an implicit security parameter $\lambda$. 
We use interchangeably ``efficient algorithm" or ``PPT algorithm'' to mean an algorithm that runs in uniform probabilistic polynomial 
time in the length of its input. A function $f(\lambda)$ is negligible in $\lambda$, written as $\mathit{negl}(\lambda)$, if $1/f(\lambda)$ 
grows faster than any polynomial in $\lambda$ and is overwhelming in $\lambda$ if $1-f(\lambda)=\mathit{negl}(\lambda)$. 
$\mathsf{poly}(\lambda)$ is some polynomial in $\lambda$ and \ewnp means except with probability $\mathit{negl}(\lambda)$.
We write $y = A(x; r)$ when algorithm $A$ on input $x$ and randomness $r$, outputs $y$. We write $y \leftarrow A(x)$ for picking 
randomness $r$ at uniformly at random and setting $y = A(x; r)$. Finally, for any integer $n \geq 1$, we denote by $[n]$ the set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$.
