\section{Hybrid Model SNARKS}
\label{sec:snarks_defs}
\noindent When proving the security of our arguments, we use an extension of some of the more commonly employed SNARK definitions which we call a ``a hybrid model SNARK''. This resembles the existing notion of SNARKs with online-offline verifiers as described in~\cite{HP_paper}, where the 
verifier computation is split into two parts: during the offline phase some computation (possibly of commitments) happens; this computation takes some public inputs as parameters and, when not performed by the verifier, it may also be performed (in part) by the prover. The online phase is the main computation performed by the verifier. In the case of our hybrid model SNARKs, however, the input to the offline counterpart described above (which we call the $\mathit{PartInput}$ algorithm) may even be the witness or 
a part of the witness for the respective relation. For our custom SNARKs, $\mathit{PartInput}$ produces part of the public input used by the verifier; 
since for our use case, $\mathit{PartInput}$ does handle a portion of the witness, this operation cannot be performed by the verifier for that relation. 
Moreover, in our instantiation, $\mathit{PartInput}$ produces computationally binding commitment schemes that are opened by the prover. Both of these properties 
are not explicitly part of our general definition for hybrid model SNARKs, but they are crucial and explicitly assumed and used 
in proving the security for our compiler's second step (see Appendix~\ref{sec_two_step_compiler}). Intuitively, our commitments 
are the counterpart CP-SNARK subcomponent of a that computes a commitment (to part of the witness) linking different CP-SNARKs together. 
We do not need such a strong property of linking SNARKs; the commitments are used in our case for the efficiency they bring to the prover/ overall system.\\

\noindent The two SNARKs we design in this work have access to a \emph{structured reference string} (srs) of the form 
$(\{[\tau^i]_1\}_{i=0}^{d}$ , $\{[\tau^i]_2\}_{i=0}^{1})$ where $\tau$ is a random (and allegedly secret) value in $\mathbb{F}$ and $d$ 
is bounded by a polynomial in $\lambda$. Such an srs is universal and updatable~\cite{updatable_universal_srs_2018}. 
We introduce a generalisation of the usual SNARK definition which we call a \emph{hybrid model SNARK} inspired by online-offline SNARKs~\cite{HP_paper}. We further refine it as described below:     

\begin{definition}(Hybrid Model SNARK)
\label{dfn_snark}
A hybrid model \emph{succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge for relation $\mathcal{R}$} is a tuple of PPT algorithms 
$(\mathit{SNARK.Setup}, \mathit{SNARK.KeyGen}, \mathit{SNARK.Prove},  \mathit{SNARK.Verify}, \mathit{SNARK.PartInputs})$ 
such that for implicit security parameter $\lambda$: 

\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathit{srs} \leftarrow \mathit{SNARK.Setup} (\mathit{aux_{\mathit{SNARK}}})$: a setup algorithm that on input auxiliary parameter 
$\mathit{aux_{\mathit{SNARK}}}$ from some domain $\mathcal{D}$ outputs a universal structured reference string tuple $\mathit{srs}$, 

\item $(\mathit{srs_{pk}}, \mathit{srs_{vk}}) \leftarrow \mathit{SNARK.KeyGen}(\mathit{srs}, \mathcal{R})$: a key generation algorithm that on input a
universal structured reference string $\mathit{srs}$ and an NP relation $\mathcal{R}$ outputs a \emph{proving key} and 
a \emph{verification key} pair $(\mathit{srs_{pk}}, \mathit{srs_{vk}})$,

\item $\pi \leftarrow \mathit{SNARK.Prove}(\mathit{srs_{pk}}, (x,w), \mathcal{R})$: a proof generation algorithm that on input a proving key 
$\mathit{srs_{pk}}$ and a pair $(x,w) \in \mathcal{R}$ outputs \emph{proof} $\pi$, 

\item $0/1 \leftarrow \mathit{SNARK.Verify}(\mathit{srs_{vk}}, x, \pi, \mathcal{R})$: a proof verification algorithm that on input a verification key 
$\mathit{srs_{vk}}$, an instance $x$ and a proof $\pi$ outputs a bit that signals acceptance (if output is $1$) or rejection (if output is $0$),

\item $(x_1, \mathit{state}_2) \leftarrow \mathit{SNARK.PartInputs}(\mathit{srs}, \mathit{state}_1, \mathcal{R})$: a deterministic 
public inputs generation algorithm that takes as input a universal structured reference string $\mathit{srs}$, an NP relation $\mathcal{R}$ and 
 state $\mathit{state}_1$ and outputs updated state $\mathit{state}_2$ and partial public input $x_1$,

\end{itemize}
and satisfies completeness, knowledge soundness w.r.t. $\mathit{SNARK.PartInputs}$ and succinctness as defined below:

\noindent \textbf{Perfect Completeness} holds if an honest prover will always convince an honest verifier: for all  
$(x,w) \in \mathcal{R}$ and for all $\mathit{aux_{\mathit{SNARK}}} \in \mathcal{D}$
\begin{align*}
& \mathit{Pr}[\mathit{SNARK.Verify}(\mathit{srs_{vk}}, x, \pi, \mathcal{R}) = 1 \ | \  
\mathit{srs} \leftarrow \mathit{SNARK.Setup}(\mathit{aux_{\mathit{SNARK}}}), \\ 
& (\mathit{srs_{pk}}, \mathit{srs_{vk}})\leftarrow \mathit{SNARK.KeyGen}(\mathit{srs}, \mathcal{R}), \pi \leftarrow \mathit{SNARK.Prove}(\mathit{srs_{pk}}, (x,w), \mathcal{R}) \ ] = 1.
\end{align*}

\noindent \textbf{Notation} We denote by $\mathit{State_{\mathcal{R}}}$ the set of all states $\mathit{state}_1$ 
such that given some relation $\mathcal{R}$ and any possible $\mathit{srs}$, 
for any output $x_1$ of  $\mathit{SNARK.PartInputs}(\mathit{srs}, \mathit{state}_1, \mathcal{R})$ 
with $\mathit{state_1} \in \mathit{State_{\mathcal{R}}}$, there exists $x_2$ and $w$ with $(x=(x_1, x_2), w) \in \mathcal{R}$; 
we further assume $\mathit{State_{\mathcal{R}}} \neq \emptyset$.\\
\vspace{-0.08in}

\noindent \textbf{Knowledge-soundness with respect to $\mathit{SNARK.PartInputs}$}
holds if there exists a PPT extractor $\mathcal{E}$ such that for all PPT 
adversaries $\mathcal{A}$, for all $\mathit{aux_{\mathit{SNARK}}} \in \mathcal{D}$ and for all $\mathit{state_1} \in \mathit{State_{\mathcal{R}}}$
\begin{align*}
&\mathit{Pr}[(x = (x_1, x_2), w) \in \mathcal{R} \wedge 1 \leftarrow \mathit{SNARK.Verify}(\mathit{srs_{vk}}, x =  (x_1, x_2), \pi, \mathcal{R}) \ | \\
&\mathit{srs} \leftarrow \mathit{SNARK.Setup}(\mathit{aux_{\mathit{SNARK}}}), (\mathit{srs_{pk}}, \mathit{srs_{vk}})\leftarrow  \mathit{SNARK.KeyGen}(\mathit{srs}, \mathcal{R}), \\ 
& (x_1, \mathit{state}_2) \leftarrow \mathit{SNARK.PartInput}(\mathit{srs}, \mathit{state}_1, \mathcal{R}), (x_2, \pi) \leftarrow \mathcal{A}(\mathit{srs}, \mathit{state}_2, \mathcal{R}), \\
& w \leftarrow \mathcal{E}^{\mathcal{A}}(srs,\mathcal{R})]
\end{align*}
\noindent is overwhelming in $\lambda$, where by $\mathcal{E}^{\mathcal{A}}$ we denote the extractor $\mathcal{E}$ that has access to all of 
$\mathcal{A}$'s messages during the protocol with the honest verifier. \\ 
\noindent \textbf{Succinctness} holds if the size of the proof $\pi$ is $\mathsf{poly}(\lambda)$ and $\mathit{SNARK.Verify}$ runs in time 
$\mathsf{poly}(\lambda + |x|)$. % $+ \log{|w|}$ has been removed in both cases.
\end{definition}
\vspace{-0.04in}
\noindent Firstly, if $x_1$, $\mathit{state_1}$ and $\mathit{state_2}$ are the empty strings, we obtain a more standard SNARK definition.
Secondly, $\mathcal{R}$ is not a component of the vector $\mathit{aux_{\mathit{SNARK}}}$ so even if $\mathit{SNARK.Setup}$ has 
$\mathit{aux_{\mathit{SNARK}}}$ as parameter, it is universal, 
i.e., it can be used to derive proving and verification keys for circuits of any size up to a polynomial in the security parameter $\lambda$,   
independently of any specific NP relation. Thirdly, for the SNARKs we design, the size of the key used by the honest verifier is much smaller than the size of the honest prover's key. To capture this special case we made the separation clear between the two keys; however, a potential adversarial prover has access to the complete $\mathit{srs}$ key. 
Moreover, our SNARKs are secure in the $\mathit{AGM}$ model~\cite{AGM_model}, i.e., security is w.r.t. $\mathit{AGM}$ 
adversaries only and by $\mathcal{E}^{\mathcal{A}}$ we denote the 
extractor $\mathcal{E}$ that has access to all of 
$\mathcal{A}$'s messages during the protocol with the honest 
verifier including the coefficients of the linear combinations of 
group elements used by the adversary at any protocol step for outputting new group elements at the next step. Finally, the auxiliary input (i.e., $\mathit{state_1}$) is required to 
be drawn from a ``benign distribution'' or else extraction may be 
impossible~\cite{extractability_limits_1,extractability_limits_2}. \\

\noindent We did not include the notion of zero-knowledge since it is not required.
