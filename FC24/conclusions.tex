In this work we have defined, designed, proved and implemented the first accountable light client system. 
This is provably secure and very efficient and can be further integrated as the core building block into secure bridges between SNARK friendly PoS blockchains. 
We plan to integrate our work into a bridge between Polkadot and Kusama, as part of the Polkadot ecosystem.
