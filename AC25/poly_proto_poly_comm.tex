\subsection{Polynomial Protocols, Polynomial Commitments and Lagrange Bases}
%\vspace{-0.05in}
To prove the security of our custom SNARKs, we start by defining custom vector-based conditional NP relations and we describe for each of them a ranged polynomial protocol. 
Extending the notion introduced in PLONK~\cite{plonk}, we give an updated definition of ranged polynomial protocols in Appendix~\ref{supplementary_poly_protocols_appendix} with the main difference 
being that our new type of polynomial protocol verifier can contribute its own polynomials or simply finite field elements based on computations involving public input and the verifier's public randomness.
Thus, our extended definition allows for a wider space of polynomial protocols, which, in turn necessary for modelling and proving security of our custom SNARKs. 
We also use KZG polynomial commitments \cite{KZG_10}, their batched version and their security definitions as described in PLONK.
