In this work we have revisited the notion of O-SNARKs in relation with a wide class of oracles which we call AGM 
respecting. On one hand, this is a class of oracles that includes signing oracles corresponding to public keys that 
are not on the same elliptic curve as the curve the SNARK prover operates on. Hence, such oracles appear often 
when modelling practical applications. Our result shows that many modern SNARKs (i.e., PLONK~\cite{plonk}, Marlin~\cite{marlin}, Groth16~\cite{groth16}, etc.) 
are in fact O-SNARKs when combined with AGM respecting oracles. On the other hand, we shade more light via a concrete 
example where and how O-SNARK security is useful for practical and more complex real-world applications.
