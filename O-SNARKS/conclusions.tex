In this work we have revisited the notion of O-SNARKs in relation with a wide class of oracles which we call AGM 
respecting. Our result shows that many modern SNARKs (i.e., PLONK~\cite{plonk}, Marlin~\cite{marlin}, Groth16~\cite{groth16}, etc.) 
are in fact O-SNARKs when combined with AGM respecting oracles. Additionally, we shed more light via a concrete 
example where and how O-SNARK security is useful for practical and non-trivial real-world applications.
