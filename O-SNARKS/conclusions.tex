In this work we have revisited the notion of O-SNARKs in relation with a wide class of oracles which we call AGM respecting. 
On one hand, this is a class of oracles that includes signing oracles corresponding to public keys that are not on the same 
elliptic curve as the curve the SNARK prover operates on. Hence, such oracles appear often when modelling practical applications. 
Our result shows that many modern SNARKs (i.e., PLONK, Marlin, Groth16 etc.) are in fact O-SNARKs when combined with AGM respecting oracles. 
On the other hand, we shade more light via concrete examples where O-SNARK security is useful for practical real-world applications.
