\subsection{SNARKs}
\label{sec:short_snarks_defs}
\noindent For proving some security properties in this work, we define and use an extension of commonly employed SNARKs definitions. We call our new notion \emph{hybrid model SNARK}. It is related to the notion of SNARKs with online-offline verifiers~\cite{HP_paper} where the verifier's computation 
is split into two parts; however it differs from that since in our case the second part of the verifier's computation is replaced by some portion of public input. 
In turn, the public input portion may depend on the witness of some NP relation, hence that portion cannot be calculated by the respective verifier himself, and, is computed instead by some (deterministic) process, external to both the prover and the verifier involved. We describe hybrid model SNARKs in full in Appendix~\ref{sec:snarks_defs}. %and we use them for the security proof in Appendix~\ref{sec_two_step_compiler}.
