\subsection{O-SNARKs}
\label{sec:short_snarks_defs}
In the following, we remind the reader the definition of an O-SNARK from~\cite{O_SNARK} and we prove that {\color{red}XXX}.
In order to do that, we start with a couple building block definitions: i.e., for algebraic adversaries (see, for example~\cite{AGM_model}) 
and our new definition of AGM respecting oracles.

\begin{definition}[Algebraic Adversaries]
\label{def:algebraic_adv}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[AGM Respecting Oracles]
\label{def:agm_oracles}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[O-SNARKs]
\label{def:osnarks}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[O-SNARKS with AGM Respecting Oracles]
\label{the:when_osnarks} 
Every $Z$ auxiliary input SNARK $\Pi$ secure in the AGM model is an 
O-SNARK for $\mathbb{O}$ if $\mathbb{O}$ is AGM respecting and 
$Z$ is defined as the probability distribution of all the public parameters that define 
$\mathbb{O}$ together with all the polynomial number $Q$ of queries and answers that 
the adversarial prover in the O-SNARK makes to the oracle $\mathbb{O}$.
\end{theorem}
