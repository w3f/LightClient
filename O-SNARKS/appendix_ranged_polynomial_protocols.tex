\section{Ranged Polynomial Protocols for NP Relations}
\label{supplementary_poly_protocols_appendix}

\noindent In the following, we keep the convention that all algorithms receive an implicit security parameter $\lambda$. The definition below 
is a natural extension of the notions of polynomial protocols and polynomial protocols for relations from Section 4 of PLONK~\cite{plonk} to 
polynomial protocols over ranges for conditional NP relations with additional refinements required by our specific use case; these refinements are 
incorporated into steps 4, 5 and 6 as follows: 

\begin{definition}(Polynomial Protocols over Ranges for Conditional NP Relations)
\label{def_ranged_poly_protocol}
Assume three parties, a prover $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$, a verifier $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ and a trusted party $\mathcal{I}$. 
Let $\mathcal{R}^c$ be a conditional NP relation (with $c$ being a predicate) and let $x$ be a public 
input both of which have been given to $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$ and $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ by an $\mathit{InitGen}$ efficient algorithm. 
For positive integers $d$, $D$, $t$, $l$, $u$, $e$ and for set 
$S \subset \mathbb{F}$, an $S$-ranged $(d, D, t, l, u, e)$-polynomial protocol $\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal{R}^c}$ for relation $\mathcal{R}^c$ is a multi-round 
protocol between $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$, $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ and $\mathcal{I}$ such that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The protocol $\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal{R}^c}$ definition includes a set of pre-processed polynomials $g_1(X), \ldots, g_l(X) \in \mathbb{F}_{<d}[X]$. 

\item The messages of $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$ are sent to $\mathcal{I}$ and are of the form $f(X)$ for $f(X) \in \mathbb{F}_{<d}[X]$. 

If $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$ sends a message not of this form, the protocol is aborted.
\item The messages from $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ to $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$ are random coins.

\item
$\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ may perform arithmetic computations using input $x$ and the random coins used in the 
communication with $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$. Let $(\mathit{res_1}, \ldots, \mathit{res_u})$ be the results of those computations 
which $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ sends to $\mathcal{I}$. 

\item 
Using vectors which are part of input $x$ and/or other ad-hoc vectors which $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ deems useful, $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ 
may compute interpolation polynomials $s_1(X), \ldots, s_e(X)$ over domain $S$ such that $s_1(X), \ldots, s_e(X) \in \mathbb{F}_{<d}[X]$. 
$\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ sends $s_1(X), \ldots, s_e(X)$ to $\mathcal{I}$. 

\item 
At the end of the protocol, suppose $f_1(X), \ldots, f_t(X)$ are the polynomials that were sent from $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$ to 
$\mathcal{I}$. $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ may ask $\mathcal{I}$ if certain polynomial identities hold between 
$$\{f_1(X), \ldots , f_t(X), g_1(X), \ldots, g_l(X), s_1(X), \ldots, s_e(X) \}$$ over set $S$ 
(i.e., if by evaluating all the polynomials that define the identity at each of the field elements from $S$ 
we obtain a true statement). Each such identity is of the form 

$$F(X) := G(X, h_1(v_1(X)), \dots , h_M(v_M(X))) \equiv 0,$$
for some $h_i(X) \in \{f_1(X), \ldots , f_t(X), g_1(X), \ldots , g_l(X), s_1(X), \ldots, s_e(X) \}$, \\ $G(X, X_1, \ldots, X_M) \in \mathbb{F}[X, X_1, \ldots , X_M]$, 
$v_1(X), \ldots , v_M(X) \in  \mathbb{F}_{<d}[X]$ such that $F(X) \in \mathbb{F}_{<D}[X]$ for every choice of 
$f_1(X), \ldots, f_t(X)$ made by $P_{poly}$ when following the protocol correctly. Note that some of the coefficients in the identities above may be 
from the set $\{\mathit{res_1}, \ldots, \mathit{res_u}\}$.
\item After receiving the answers from $I$ regarding the polynomial identities, 
$\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ outputs $\mathsf{acc}$ if all identities hold over set $S$, 
and outputs $\mathsf{rej}$ otherwise.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Additionally, the following properties hold: \\

\noindent \textbf{Perfect Completeness:} If $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$ follows the protocol correctly and uses a witness $\omega$ with 
$(x, \omega) \in \mathcal{R}^c$, $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ accepts with probability one.

\noindent \textbf{Knowledge Soundness:} There exists an efficient algorithm $E$, that given access to the messages of $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$ 
to $\mathcal{I}$ it outputs $\omega$ such that, for any strategy of $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$, the probability of $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ 
outputting $\mathsf{acc}$ at the end of the protocol and, simultaneously, $(x, \omega) \in \mathcal{R}^c$ is overwhelming in $\lambda$.

\end{definition}

\noindent Our definition for polynomial protocols over ranges does not include a zero-knowledge property as it is not required in our current work. \\

\noindent{\color{red} TO DO: Make sure that the definition of SNARK we use in the rest of the paper (unification of Dario's and of hybrid model SNARKs) is what we also mean below. 
Also, make sure we call the unified SNARK notion the same way throughout the paper. Add a proof for lemma below and refer to it in the rest of the paper.} \\

\noindent Given the definition for polynomial protocols over ranges for conditional relations as detailed above, we are now ready to state the following result.
The proof follows with only minor changes from that of Lemmas 4.5. and 4.7. from~\cite{plonk}. 

\begin{lemma}(Compilation of Ranged Polynomial Protocols for Conditional NP Relations into SNARKs using PLONK) 
\label{le:compilation_step_1}
Let $\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal{R}^c}$ be a public coin $S$-ranged $(d, D, t, l, u, e)$-polynomial protocol for relation $\mathcal{R}^c$ where only 
one identity is checked by $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ and predicate $c$ from the definition of ${\mathcal{R}^c}$ needs to be fulfilled only by a part $x_1$ 
of the public input of the relation ${\mathcal{R}^c}$. Then one can construct a SNARK protocol $\mathscr{P}^*_{\mathcal{R}^c}$ for relation 
$\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal{R}^c}$ with $\mathit{SNARK.PartInput}$ as defined below 
and with $\mathscr{P}^*_{\mathcal{R}^c}$ secure in the AGM under the $2d$-DLOG 
assumption\footnote{Definition 2.1. in PLONK~\cite{plonk} formally describes the $2d$-DLOG assumption.} such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The prover $\mathbf{P}$ in $\mathscr{P}^*_{\mathcal{R}^c}$ requires $\mathsf{e}(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal{R}^c})$ $\gout{1}$-exponentiations where 
$\mathsf{e}(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal{R}^c})$ is define analogously as in PLONK (see preamble of Section 4.2.), however it additionally takes into account 
polynomials $s_1(X), \ldots, s_e(X)$. 
\item The total prover communication consists of $t + t^*(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal{R}^c}) + 1$ $\gout{1}$-elements and M $\mathbb{F}$-elements, where 
$t^*(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal{R}^c})$ is defined identically as in PLONK (see preamble of Section 4.2.).
\item The verifier $\mathbf{V}$ in $\mathscr{P}^*_{\mathcal{R}^c}$ requires $t + t^*(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal{R}^c})+1$ $\gout{1}$-exponentiations, 
two pairings and one evaluation of the polynomial $G$, and, additionally, the verifier in $\mathscr{P}^*_{\mathcal{R}^c}$ computes $e$ 
polynomial commitments to polynomials in the set $\{s_1(X), \ldots, s_e(X)\}$. 
\item For $x_1$ part of  $\mathit{state_1}$, the algorithm for computing partial inputs is defined as 
\begin{align*}
&\mathit{SNARK.PartInput}(\mathit{srs}, \mathit{state_1}, \mathcal{R}^c) \\
&\mathit{If \ } c(x_1) = 0 \\
&\ \ \ \ \mathit{Return} \\
&\mathit{Else } \\
&\ \ \ \ \mathit{Return} (\mathit{state_1}, x_1)
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
