Assume a set $S$ of public keys instantiated by points on a pairing-friendly elliptic curve and assume polynomial commitments $C_{S,x}$ and $C_{S,y}$ 
to the vectors of $x$ and $y$ of affine coordinates, respectively, of the public keys in $S$. In the following, we construct 
a \emph{counting SNARK} which allows a prover to convince an efficient verifier that an alleged 
aggregated public key has been computed correctly as an aggregate (i.e., a sum) of a subset $U$ of the public keys in $S$, 
when $C_{S,x}$ and $C_{S,y}$ have been given as inputs. Additionally, our counting SNARK ensures that the alleged 
aggregated public key, in turn, is a scalar product between the entire set of public keys in $S$ and a \emph{bitvector} with one bit associated to each public key 
for signalling the inclusion or omission of the respective public key in the subset $U$.  
{\color{blue} TO DO We conclude this section by mentioning how to transform the counting SNARK into a SNARK for building non-accountable light client systems.} \\

\noindent To compile our desired SNARK, we proceed as follows: in Section~\ref{sec_vt}, we define vector-based 
conditional NP relations $\Rvt$ (i.e., counting) and we design a ranged polynomial protocol $\Rvt$ for this relation. 
The ranged polynomial protocol notion originates in~\cite{plonk}; we give a reminder of it in 
Appendix~\ref{supplementary_poly_protocols_appendix} including a refinement introduced in~\cite{LC_paper}. In 
Section~\ref{sec:interesting}, we use the two-steps PLONK-based compiler introduced in~\cite{LC_paper} which is 
necessary to compile the counting ranged polynomial protocol $\Rvt$ into an O-SNARK for an NP relation based on mixed 
vector and pair of polynomial commitments; we denote this relation by $\Rvtcom$. \\

\noindent To start with, we define our vector based counting NP relation over $\mathbb{F}$ which is the base field of a pairing friendly 
elliptic curve $\einn$. Our SNARK prover's circuit is defined as well over $\mathbb{F}$ as the scalar field of a second pairing friendly elliptic 
curve $\eout$. The vector of public keys, which is part of the public input for $\Rvt$ and is denoted by 
$\mathbf{pk} = (\mathit{pk_0}, \ldots, \mathit{pk_{n-2}})$, is a vector of pairs with each component in $\mathbb{F}$. 
This vector has size $n-1$, where $n$ is the order of a group $H$ defined below. For $\Rvt$, we denote by $\mathbf{bit}$ a bitvector with 
$n$ components where $\mathbf{bit} = (\mathit{bit_0}, \ldots, \mathit{bit_{n-1}})$, meaning that each component $\mathit{bit_i}$ belongs 
to $\mathbb{B} \subset \mathbb{F}$). Each bit $\mathit{bit_i}$ signals  whether the index-wise corresponding public key $(\mathit{pk_i}$ 
is aggregated (i.e., summed in) or not into the aggregated public key $\mathit{apk}$. The $n$-th component $\mathit{bit_{n-1}}$ does 
not correspond to any public key, but, as will become clear in the following, has been included for easier design of constraints. \\ 

\vspace{-0.009in}
\noindent We denote by $H$ the multiplicative subgroup of $\mathbb{F}$ generated 
by an $n$-th root of unity $\omega$. We denote by \\ $\mathit{incl}(a_0, \ldots, a_{n-2})$ the inclusion 
predicate that checks if $(a_0, \ldots, a_{n-2}) \in \ginn{1}^{n-1}$, where $\ginn{1}$ is the first source group 
of pairing function associated with $\einn$. Moreover, let $h = (\mathit{h_x}, \mathit{h_y})$ be some fixed, 
publicly known element in $\einn \setminus \ginn{1}$. We denote by $(a_x, a_y)$ the affine representation in 
$x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of $a \in \einn$ and by $\oplus$ the point addition in affine coordinates on the 
elliptic curve $\einn$. \\

\subsection{Counting Ranged Polynomial Protocol}
\label{sec_vt}

\noindent Next, we introduce the following Lagrange interpolation polynomials of degree at most $n-1 = |H|$ over cyclic group $H$: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $b(X)$ - interpolates the bits of bitvector $\mathit{bit}$; 
\item $pkx(X)$, $pky(X)$ - interpolate all public keys' $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively; 
\item $kaccx(X)$, $kaccy(X)$ - interpolate $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, 
of the iterative partial aggregate sum of the actual signing validators' public keys. 
\end{itemize}
\noindent We also define six polynomial identities $id_1(X)=0, \ldots, id_6(X)=0$ supporting the following intuition:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $id_1(X)=0$ and $id_2(X)=0$ hold over $H$, this 
ensures the $x$ and, respectively, the $y$ coordinates of the iterative partial 
aggregate sums of the public keys (up to each index $i \leq n-2$) follow formulas $(\ast)$, $(\ast\ast)$ from Observation 1 (see Appendix~\ref{sec:delayed}) 
which gives all possible cases of complete curve point addition when the second curve point is multiplied by a bit; 
\item If $id_3(X)=0$ and $id_4(X)=0$ hold over $H$, this  
ensure the first partial aggregate sum is $h$ and the total aggregate sum is $h + \mathit{apk}$; this is necessary in order to ensure the 
addition of the public keys (i.e., elliptic curve points) never falls into condition (3) defined in Observation 1 (see Appendix~\ref{sec:delayed}). 
This recursively implies the partial aggregate sum at every step is a well defined curve point, hence, it is a suitable input for the next step; 
\item If $id_5(X)=0$ holds over $H$, this 
ensures $b(X)$ evaluates to bits over $H$. 
\item If $id_6(X)= 0$ holds  over $H$, this 
ensures that the sum of bits in the bitvector $\mathit{bit}$ is $s+1$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Intuitively and overall, if the identities $\{id_i(X)=0\}_{i \in [6]}$ hold over $H$, this 
ensures $\mathit{apk}$ is the aggregated public key of at least $s$ and at most $s+1$ public keys. 
Hence, we interpret $s$ as a threshold on the number of public keys included in the aggregated public key. 
Note that since $\mathit{bit_{n-1}}$ as the last component of the bitmask witness $\mathit{bit}$ does not correspond to any public 
key and we have to account for the fact that $\mathit{bit_{n-1}}$ may be 
$1 \in \mathbb{F}$, relation $\Rvt$ includes the off-by-one constraint $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \mathit{bit_i} = s+1$.\\

\item $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ accepts if all of $\mathcal{I}$'s checks verify. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent We show that protocol $\Pvt$ is an $H$-ranged polynomial protocol for conditional relation 
$\Rvt$. 

\begin{lemma} $\Pvt$ as described above is an $H$-ranged polynomial protocol for conditional relation $\Rvt$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It is easy to see that perfect completeness holds. Indeed, if $(\mathbf{bit},\mathbf{pk}, \mathit{apk}) \in \Rvt$ holds, 
meaning that $\mathbf{bit} \in \mathbb{B}^n$ and $\mathbf{pk} \in \ginn{1}^{n-1}$ and $\mathit{apk} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [\mathit{bit_i}] \cdot \mathit{pk_i}$ and 
$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \mathit{bit_i} = s+1$ hold, then it is easy to see that the honest prover $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$ in $\Pvt$ will convince the honest 
verifier $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ in $\Pvt$ to accept with probability $1$. \\
Regarding knowledge-soundness, if the verifier $\mathcal{V}_{poly}$ in $\Pvt$ accepts, 
then we construct the extractor $\mathcal{E}$ in the following way. Using the polynomial $b(X)$ which 
was part of the messages from $\mathcal{P}_{poly}$ to $\mathcal{I}$ and evaluating it at the elements of the set 
$H$, $\mathcal{E}$ obtains evaluation vector $\mathbf{bit} = (b(1), \ldots, b(\omega^{n-1}))$ which, 
in the following, we denote as $(\mathit{bit}_0, \ldots, \mathit{bit}_{n-1}) \in \mathbb{F}^n$.\\ 
\noindent Next, we show that if $(\mathit{pk_0}, \ldots, \mathit{pk_{n-2}}) \in \ginn{1}^{n-1}$ holds and the 
verifier in $\Pvt$ accepts, then 
$$((\mathit{pk_0}, \ldots, \mathit{pk_{n-2}}), s, \mathit{apk}, (\mathit{bit_0}, \ldots, \mathit{bit_{n-1}})) \in \Rvt,$$ 
which is equivalent to proving that $\mathit{apk} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [\mathit{bit_i}]  \cdot \mathit{pk_i}$ and 
$\mathbf{bit} \in \mathbb{B}^n$ and  $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \mathit{bit_i} = s+1$.
\noindent First, since $id_6(X) = 0$ holds over $H$, we can expand that as follows:
\begin{align*}
acc_{vt,1} &= acc_{vt,0} + \mathit{bit}_{0} \\
acc_{vt, 2} &= acc_{vt,1} + \mathit{bit}_{1} \\
\ldots \\
acc_{vt,n-1} &= acc_{vt,n-2} + \mathit{bit}_{n-2} \\
acc_{vt,0} &= acc_{vt,n-1} + \mathit{bit}_{n-1} - (s+1).
\end{align*}
\noindent By summing together the LHS and, respectively, the RHS of the equalities above and 
reducing the equal terms, we obtain $s+1 = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\mathit{bit}_i \ \ \ \ (1)$. \\ 
Second, since it holds over $H$ that $id_i(X) = 0$, $\forall i \in [5]$ and $b(\omega^i) = \mathit{bit_i}, \forall i<n$ (by the definition 
of $\mathcal{E}$), the properties concluded in Claim~\ref{claim:keys_affine_comm} from Appendix~\ref{sec:delayed} hold. We call this property $(2)$.
%Combining the two proof steps above, we obtain the desired conclusion.
{\color{red} TO DO: Is the next sentence correct/enough? By combining the properties in $(1)$ and $(2)$, we obtain the desired conclusion.}
\end{proof}

\subsection{From a Polynomial Protocol to an O-SNARK}
\label{sec:interesting}
\noindent One can use the standard PLONK compiler (see Lemma 4.7~\cite{plonk}) to compile the 
counting ranged polynomial protocol for relation $\Rvt$ introduced in Section~\ref{sec_vt} 
into a SNARK $\Pi_{\Rvt}$ for the same relation. More precisely, let $\mathbb{O}$ be an 
AGM respecting oracle as per Definition~\ref{def:agm_oracles} and let $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathbb{O}}$ be defined as in the statement of Theorem~\ref{the:when_osnarks}. 
Then according to the PLONK compiler, $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathbb{O}}$ auxiliary input $\Pi_{\Rvt}$ is a SNARK.
Next, invoking Theorem~\ref{the:when_osnarks}, one can prove that $\Pi_{\Rvt}$ is an O-SNARK for $\mathbb{O}$. \\

\noindent In fact, what we have described so far corresponds to the first step of the compiler for the two-step compiler 
introduced in~\cite{LC_paper}.\footnote{As a reminder, the first compilation step in~\cite{LC_paper} uses a standard PLONK compiler.}
TO DO: PROVE THIS HOLDS IF NECESSARY. Next, using a similar technique as the one employed in the proof of Theorem~\ref{the:when_osnarks}, one can show that 
$\mathcal{Z}_{\mathbb{O}}$ auxiliary input $\Pi_{\Rvtcom}$ is an O-SNARK for relation $\Rvtcom$, where

%$$\Rvtcom = {\color{red}Fill \ in. \ }$$

%\begin{align*}
%& {\Rlacom} = \{(\mathbf{C} \in \mathcal{C}, \mathbf{bit} \in \mathbb{B}^n, \mathit{apk} \in \mathbb{F}^2; \mathbf{pk}) : 
%\mathit{apk} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [\mathit{bit_i}] \cdot \mathit{pk_i} \ | \\ & | \ \mathbf{pk} \in \ginn{1}^{n-1} \ \wedge \  \mathbf{C} = \mathbf{Com}(\mathbf{pk}) \} 
%\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
 {\Rvtcom} = \{&(\mathbf{C} \in \mathcal{C}, \mathit{apk} \in \mathbb{F}^2, s \in \mathbb{F}; \mathbf{pk}, \mathbf{bit}) : 
                       \mathit{apk} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [\mathit{bit_i}] \cdot \mathit{pk_i} \  | \ \mathbf{pk} \in \ginn{1}^{n-1} \ \wedge \  \\
                       & \wedge \ \mathbf{bit} \in \mathbb{B}^n \ \wedge \ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \mathit{bit_i} = s+1 \ \wedge \ \mathbf{C} = \mathbf{Com}(\mathbf{pk}) \} 
\end{align*}
%\begin{equation*}
%\begin{split}
% \Rvt = & \{(\mathbf{pk} \in (\mathbb{F}^2)^{n-1}, s \in \mathbb{F}, \mathit{apk} \in \mathbb{F}^2; \mathbf{bit}) : 
% \mathit{apk} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [\mathit{bit_i}]  \cdot \mathit{pk_i} \ | \ \mathbf{pk}  \in \ginn{1}^{n-1} \ \wedge \\ 
%& \wedge \ \mathbf{bit} \in \mathbb{B}^n \ \wedge \ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \mathit{bit_i} = s+1\} 
%\end{split}
%\end{equation*}
\noindent where $\mathit{Com}$ denotes the KZG polynomial commitment, 
$\mathcal{C}$ is the set of all $\mathit{KZG}$ poly commitments or vectors of such poly commitments and $\mathbf{C}$ is an alleged tuple of such commitments.


\noindent In turn, by using $\Pi_{\Rvtcom}$ as an $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathbb{O}}$ auxiliary input O-SNARK and an aggregatable signature 
scheme as defined also in~\cite{LC_paper}, one can construct a non-accountable light client scheme which is a very close analog 
to the accountable light client schemes introduced in~\cite{LC_paper}. While the perfect completeness for the non-accountable light client scheme 
can requires perfect completeness of the O-SNARK (which, in turn, is identical to the perfect completeness for a SNARK scheme), 
the soundness of the non-accountable scheme makes direct use of the knowledge-soundness 
property of the $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathbb{O}}$ auxiliary input O-SNARK for $\Pi_{\Rvtcom}$ which is specific for O-SNARKs. 
For more details on why is crucial we use an O-SNARK for the soundness security proof, please read Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.
