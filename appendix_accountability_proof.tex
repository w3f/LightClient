\section{Postponed Security Proof for Accountable Light Client Systems}
\label{supplementary_proof_sec_accountability}

\noindent In this section we prove the following theorem:

\begin{theorem} 
\label{th:accountability_results}
If $\mathit{AS}$ is the secure aggregatable signature scheme defined in Instantiation~\ref{insta:bls} and if 
$\mathit{CKS_{\mathcal{R}}}$ is the secure committee key scheme defined in Instantiation~\ref{inst:cks}, then, together 
with the assumptions stated at the beginning of Section~\ref{sec:assumptions} and for $\mathcal{R} \in \{ \Rlacom, \Racom \}$, the tuple 
($\mathit{LC.Setup}$, $\mathit{LC.GenerateProof}$, $\mathit{LC.VerifyProof}$, $\mathit{LC.DetectMisbehaviour}$, 
$\mathit{LC.VerifyMisbehaviour}$) as instantiated in Section~\ref{sec:instantiation} is an accountable light client system.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\noindent Due to theorem~\ref{th:soundness}, the tuple 
($\mathit{LC.Setup}$, $\mathit{LC.GenerateProof}$, $\mathit{LC.VerifyProof}$, \\ $\mathit{LC.DetectMisbehaviour}$, 
$\mathit{LC.VerifyMisbehaviour}$) as instantiated in Section~\ref{sec:instantiation} is already a light client system. 
It is only left to show that both accountability completeness and accountability soundness also hold. Indeed: \\

\noindent \textit{Accountability Completeness:} %This follows immediately from the description of $\mathit{LC.DetectMisbehaviour}$ 
%and $\mathit{LC.VerifyMisbehaviour}$, from the fact that $$\mathit{LC.VerifyProof}(\pi, m, \mathcal{R}) = \mathit{acc}$$ 
%and $$\mathit{CheckValidConsensus}(C)=1$$ and from the existence of a message $\mathit{aux}$ in $C$ that has 
%been decided and is incompatible with the message $m$ supported by $\pi$. \\
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an efficient adversary that on input $\mathit{pp_{\mathit{LC}}}$ and $\mathcal{R}$ outputs 
 $\pi$, $m$ and $C$. It is easy to see that if the descriptions of $\mathit{LC.DetectMisbehaviour}$ and $\mathit{LC.VerifyMisbehaviour}$ are followed honestly,  
then the predicate $S_{m''} \cap S_{m'} = S$ checked in the end of $\mathit{LC.VerifyMisbehaviour}$ is fulfilled. Moreover, due to the satisfied predicate
$$\mathit{LC.VerifyProof}(\mathit{pp}, \mathit{rs_{\mathit{vk}}}, \LCseed, \pi, m, \mathcal{R}) = 1 \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)$$ %{\color{blue} due to the description of 
%$\mathit{LC.DetectMisbehaviour}$ plus the fact that $C$ is a valid consensus view as per the definition of accountability security challenge, }
it holds that all $m_j, j \in [i]$ (as defined in $\mathit{LC.VerifyProof}$) are decided in $C$. Due to the way $m'$ and $m''$ are computed 
by $\mathit{LC.DetectMisbehaviour}$ from the messages $(m_j)_{j=1}^i$, this implies $|S_{m'}| \geq t$, $|S_{m''}| \geq t$ and $(\mathit{m'}, d_{\mathit{m'}}) \in_{\mathit{decided}} C$ and 
 $$\mathit{Incompatible(m'', m', d_{m'})} = 1.$$ We are only left to show that 
 $$\mathit{AS.Verify}(\mathit{pp}, \mathit{apk}, m'', \sigma) =1 \ \ \ \ (*)$$ 
\noindent holds with overwhelming probability. Indeed, since $(1)$ holds then, for every epoch $j \in [i]$ it holds that 
$$\mathit{CKS_{\mathcal{R}}.Verify}(\mathit{pp},  \mathit{rs_{\mathit{vk}}}, \mathit{com_j}, m_j,  \mathbf{\Sigma}(j), (\mathbf{\pi_{j}},\mathit{apk_j}), 
\mathbf{bit_j}) = 1 \ \ \ \ (2).$$
\noindent In particular, $(2)$ holds for $j = \mathit{index}$. Due to soundness property of the committee key scheme $\mathit{CKS_{\mathcal{R}}}$, 
since $\mathit{com_{\mathit{index}}} = \mathbf{Com}(\mathbf{pk_{\mathbf{index}}})$ by the definition of $\mathit{index}$ and 
$\mathit{LC.DetectMisbehaviour}$, since $\mathit{apk_{\mathit{index}}} = \mathit{AS.AggregateKeys}(\mathit{pp}, 
(\mathbf{bit_{\mathbf{index}}}(k) \cdot \mathbf{pk_{\mathbf{index}}}(k))_{k=1}^v)$ as computed by $\mathit{LC.DetectMisbehaviour}$, 
since also $m'' = m_{\mathit{index}}$ (with $m_j, \forall j \in [i]$ defined in $\mathit{LC.VerifyProof}$ and $\mathit{index}$ defined 
in \\ $\mathit{LC.DetectMisbehaviour}$) and, finally, since $\mathbf{\Sigma}(\mathit{index}) = \sigma$, as defined in $\mathit{LC.DetectMisbehaviour}$, 
it follows that $(*)$ holds with overwhelming probability (q.e.d.). \\
 
\noindent \textit{Accountability Soundness:} Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an efficient adversary who interacts with an honest validator. If $\mathit{LC.VerifyMisbehaviour}(\mathit{pp}, i, S, \mathbf{bit}, \sigma, m'', m', C)$ 
outputs $\mathit{acc}$ $(\ast)$, its checks together with completeness for aggregation imply 
$$\mathit{AS.Verify}(\mathit{pp}, \sigma', m', \mathit{apk_S}) = 1 \ \ (\ast\ast),$$
where 
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{\sigma_i}(j) =
    \begin{cases}
      \mathit{sig} & \text{if }  \exists \ \mathit{sig} \in C, \mathit{AS.Verify}(\mathit{pp}, \mathit{sig}, m', \mathbf{pk_i}(j)) \\
      \_ & \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases}       
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{b_{S}}(j) =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if }  \mathbf{pk_i}(j) \in S \\
      0 & \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases}       
\end{equation*}
$$ \sigma' \leftarrow  \mathit{AS.AggregateSignatures}(\mathit{pp}, (\mathbf{b_{S}}(j) \cdot \mathbf{\sigma_i}(j))_{j=1}^v),$$
$$\mathit{apk_S} \leftarrow \mathit{AS.AggregateKeys}(\mathit{pp},(\mathbf{b_{S}}(j) \cdot \mathbf{pk_i}(j))_{j=1}^v),$$

\noindent Additionally, since $(\ast)$ holds and for $\mathit{apk}$ as defined in $\mathit{LC.VerifyMisbehaviour}$, we obtain
$$\mathit{AS.Verify}(\mathit{pp}, \sigma, m'', \mathit{apk}) = 1 \ \ (\ast \ast').$$
%Note that $m'$, $m''$, $\sigma$ are part of the input of $\mathit{LC.VerifyMisbehaviour}$ and 
%\noindent Note that $(\ast)$ holds due to perfect completeness of aggregation 
%and $(\ast')$ holds as part of the checks that $\mathit{LC.VerifyMisbehaviour}$ outputs $1$. \\
\noindent Since $\mathit{CheckValidConsensus}(C) = 1$ holds and $m'$ has been decided in epoch $i$ of $C$ 
and $d_{m'}$ is the required data associated with $m'$, due to assumptions (I.5.), (I.4.) and (I.2.) we have 
that $d_{m'}$ contains correct proofs of possession for all keys in $\mathbf{pk_i}$ \ $(\ast\ast\ast)$. \\ 
\noindent We assume by contradiction that $S \cap Q_{\mathit{pks}}$ is non-empty with more than negligible probability. 
Since the following check (which is part of $\mathit{LC.VerifyMisbehaviour}$) passes:  
$$S_{m''} \cap S_{m'} =S,$$ any $\mathit{pk} \in S$ is aggregated into $\mathit{apk}$ and also into $\mathit{apk_S}$; 
this includes $\mathit{pk^*}$. Since the aggregate signature instantiation $\mathit{AS}$ is unforgeable 
(see Definition~\ref{def:aggregate_signatures} plus the assumption (S.1.)), due to $(\ast\ast)$, $(\ast\ast')$, $(\ast\ast\ast)$ and 
$(\ast\ast\ast\ast)$ we have that, with more than negligible probability, both $m'$ and $m''$ have 
been signed by the honest validator. However, this contradicts that 
$\mathit{Incompatible}(m', m'', d_{m'}) = 1$ which is ensured by assumption (B.2.). Hence, our assumption is false and $S \cap \mathit{Q_{pks}} = \emptyset$, so the 
probability defined in the accountability soundness property is indeed negligible. 

%If $\mathit{LC.VerifyMisbehaviour}$ outputs $1$, its checks imply that the 
%aggregate signature $\sigma$ (used as input by $\mathit{LC.VerifyMisbehaviour}$) on $m''$ passes the verification of 
%$\mathit{AS.Verify}$; analogously, since $m'$ with required data $d_m'$ was decided in $C$, there is an aggregate 
%signature of at least $t$ individual signatures on $m'$ that pass verification of $\mathit{AS.Verify}$. Moreover, each 
%of the public keys in $S$ sign both $m'$ and $m''$ (relation we denote by $(\ast)$) and 
%$\mathit{Incompatible}(m', m'', d_m') = 1$ and $\mathit{epoch_{id}}(m') = \mathit{epoch_{id}}(m'') = i$ hold (two 
%relations we together denote by $(\ast\ast)$). 
%We assume by contradiction that with more than a negligible probability $S \cap \mathit{Q_{keys}} \neq \emptyset$.  
\end{proof}
