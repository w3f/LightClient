In this work we have defined, designed, proved and implemented the first accountable light client system. This is both provably secure and 
very efficient and can be further integrated as the core building block into secure bridges between SNARK friendly PoS blockchains. We are 
currently working on integrating everything discussed above into a live Substrate bridge between Polkadot and Kusama, as part of the Polkadot ecosystem.
